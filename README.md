# Surfs_Ups
SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask 
# Overview:
Report the key differences in weather between June and December in Oahu, and two recommendations for further analysis to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results:

**June Statistics for Temperature**

**December Statistics for Temperature**

* The mean temperature of 75°F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F for December. 
* The standard deviation between June (3.25) and December (3.75) are both fairly low, showing temperatures are fairly consistent during both months.
* There is a drastic difference between the minimum temperatures, with 10 degrees for June (avg. 74, low 64) and 15 degrees for December (avg.71, low 56).

# Summary: 
The investor's main concern was getting rained out too frequently. The temperature appears fairly consistent, although the lows of December could deter some tourists. I would recommend doing an additional query for precipitation for June and December, to see if the results would support opening a Surf and Ice Cream shop year-round.  Then I would recommend running an additional query to graph these results, in order to gain a visual perspective.
